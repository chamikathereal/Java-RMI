# **Java-RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**

This repository contains two projects: **RMIServer** and **RMIClient**, demonstrating the use of Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for communication between a client and a server.

## **RMIServer**

The **RMIServer** project implements a server that exposes two remote services using RMI:

1. **Message Service**: A simple service with the `hello(String name)` method, which returns a greeting message.
2. **Student Service**: A service providing a list of `Student` objects, accessed via the `getStudents()` method.

### **Usage**:

1. The **RMIServer** binds both services (`message_service` and `student_service`) to the RMI registry on port `6666`.
2. The server listens for incoming client requests and responds with the appropriate data from the remote methods.

### **Running RMIServer**:

To start the server, run the **`RMIServer.java`** file:

```bash
java lk.jiat.rmi.RMIServer
```

This will start the RMI server and bind the remote services to the registry.

## **RMIClient**

The **RMIClient** project is a client application that interacts with the **RMIServer** by calling the remote services exposed by the server.

1. **Message Service**: The client calls the `message_service` to retrieve a greeting.
2. **Student Service**: The client calls the `student_service` to get a list of students.

### **Usage**:

1. The **RMIClient** connects to the server's RMI registry running on `localhost:6666`.
2. It looks up and calls the `message_service` for a greeting.
3. It also calls the `student_service` to retrieve a list of students.

### **Running RMIClient**:

To run the client, execute the **`RMIClient.java`** file:

```bash
java lk.jiat.rmi.RMIClient
```

The client will connect to the RMI server and display:

* A greeting from the `message_service`.
* A list of students fetched from the `student_service`.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chamikathereal/Java-RMI.git
cd Java-RMI
```

### 2. Build the Projects:

Make sure you have **Java** and a build tool like **Maven** or **Gradle** installed. If using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Run the RMIServer:

In the **RMIServer** project, run the **`RMIServer.java`** file to start the server:

```bash
java lk.jiat.rmi.RMIServer
```

### 4. Run the RMIClient:

In the **RMIClient** project, run the **`RMIClient.java`** file to start the client:

```bash
java lk.jiat.rmi.RMIClient
```

## **Example Output**

After running the **RMIClient**, you should see output similar to this:

```bash
message_service
Hello, Chamika
1 Krishan : Kandy
2 Kamal : Colombo
3 Krishan : Gall
```
